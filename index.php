      <p class="flow-text">FoodNotes allows the users to realize how much of their food is not eaten, in term of money. We calculate total price of all items according to the statistics from the Government Of Canada. All leftover or unused food is counted towards a wasted total amount. Our enthusiatic and passionate team will send you notifications to remind you about how much your food is not eaten, and encourage you to reduce food waste and save money.</p>
